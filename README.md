# StreakyAndroidApp

## Idea

This app is designed for tracking habits. Its peculiarity is the presence of human observers who check the fulfillment of the habit.

There is a fairly well-known psychological fact that it is better for a person to stick to his words and actions if he promised it in front of someone. However, it works differently for different people. For some, it is more effective to rely on friends, for others on strangers. In this application, there is surveillance from both sides. That's why our app will be effective for everyone!
